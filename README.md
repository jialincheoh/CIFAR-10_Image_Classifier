# CIFAR-10_Image_Classifier

CIFAR-10
Your image classifier will be trained and evaluated on one of the most classic and well-studied computer vision data sets, CIFAR-10. This dataset has spurred loads of innovation in neural network design and implementation. The current state of the art is a 99% accuracy rate, achieved by GPipe, which has 557 million parameters and was developed in late 2018. GPipe is an extremely large network with a lot of advanced techniques not introduced in this course, but feel free to use any architecture that suits your needs.

Your classifier should be able to classify images like these:
